## Description

In today's dynamic development environment, testing is not just an afterthought but a critical part of the development process. The **Tech Quiz Test Suite** project builds upon a fully functioning Tech Quiz application—developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js)—by integrating Cypress for comprehensive testing. This project adds both component and end-to-end tests to ensure the application performs reliably under various conditions. Users can take a tech quiz featuring ten random questions and view their final score, allowing aspiring developers to test their knowledge and improve their skills.
